                    <p data-testid="test-about-bio">
                        I'm a passionate developer and lifelong learner committed to building meaningful digital experiences. 
                        With a strong foundation in web development, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and best practices 
                        to create accessible, responsive, and user-friendly applications. I believe in the power of clean code, 
                        semantic HTML, and thoughtful design to make the web a better place for everyone.

                    <h3>Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
                    <p data-testid="test-about-confidence">
                        While I'm building a solid foundation, I recognize that advanced JavaScript concepts like closures, 
                        prototypes, and async/await patterns still require more practice. I'm also working on improving my 
                        understanding of complex CSS layouts and animations. Additionally, I want to strengthen my knowledge 
                        of backend technologies and databases. However, I'm committed to continuous learning and view these 
                        areas as opportunities for growth rather than limitations.

                    <h3>Note to Future Self</h3>
                    <p data-testid="test-about-future-note">
                        Remember that every expert was once a beginner. The challenges you face today are building blocks for 
                        your future success. Stay curious, embrace mistakes as learning opportunities, and don't compare your 
                        beginning to someone else's middle. Keep pushing forward, celebrate small wins, and remember why you 
                        started this journey. You've got this!

                    <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
                    <p data-testid="test-about-extra">
                        I'm excited about the intersection of design and development, where beautiful interfaces meet clean code. 
                        I believe that accessibility isn't an afterthought but a fundamental part of good design. I'm also passionate 
                        about mentoring others and sharing knowledge with the community. Looking forward to collaborating with talented 
                        individuals and creating projects that make a real impact.
